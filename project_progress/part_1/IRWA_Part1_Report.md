## 1. Introduction

This report presents the work completed for **Part 1** of the IRWA (Information Retrieval and Web Analytics) Final Project. The objective of this part is to prepare and analyze a fashion products dataset through comprehensive text processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

The work is divided into two main components:

- **Data Preparation:** Loading, cleaning, normalizing, tokenizing, and preprocessing the raw dataset
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Statistical analysis, visualization, and insights extraction

The dataset consists of fashion product listings with fields including title, description, category, price, rating, brand, and other metadata. The goal is to prepare this data for subsequent information retrieval tasks (indexing, searching, ranking) in later parts of the project.

---

## 2. Data Preparation

### 2.1 Dataset Overview

The raw dataset is provided in JSON format containing fashion product records. Each record includes:

**Text fields:**
- title
- description
- category, subcategory
- product details

**Numeric fields:**
- price
- rating
- number of reviews
- discount

**Categorical fields:**
- brand
- seller
- color, size, material

**Boolean fields:**
- out_of_stock
- availability status

#### Data Loading Process

We implemented a robust loader (`load_data()`) that automatically detects and handles both JSON array format and JSON Lines (JSONL) format. This ensures compatibility regardless of how the dataset is structured.

```python
def load_data(file_path: str | Path) -> pd.DataFrame:
    p = Path(file_path)
    with p.open('r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        first = f.read(1)
        f.seek(0)
        if first == '[':
            data = json.load(f)  # JSON array
        else:
            data = [json.loads(line) for line in f if line.strip()]  # JSONL
    return pd.DataFrame(data)
```

### 2.2 Text Cleaning and Normalization

Text cleaning is crucial for effective information retrieval. We implemented a comprehensive `clean_text()` function that performs the following operations:

#### 1. HTML Processing
- Unescape HTML entities (`&amp;`, `&lt;`, `&quot;`, etc.)
- Remove HTML tags using BeautifulSoup

#### 2. Case Normalization
- Convert all text to lowercase for consistency

#### 3. Unicode Normalization
- Apply NFKC normalization to handle special characters and diacritics

#### 4. Content Filtering
- Remove URLs (`http://`, `www.`)
- Remove punctuation and special symbols
- Remove digits (numbers are generally not useful for text search)
- Collapse multiple whitespace into single spaces

**Rationale:** These steps ensure that the text is in a consistent, normalized form that improves the quality of tokenization and reduces noise in the vocabulary.

```python
def clean_text(text: str) -> str:
    # Unescape HTML and strip tags
    text = html.unescape(text)
    text = BeautifulSoup(text, "html.parser").get_text(separator=" ")
    
    # Lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    
    # Remove URLs
    text = re.sub(r"http\S+|www\S+", " ", text)
    
    # Remove punctuation, digits, and non-alphabetic characters
    text = re.sub(r"[^a-z\s]", " ", text)
    
    # Collapse multiple spaces
    text = re.sub(r"\s+", " ", text).strip()
    
    return text
```

### 2.3 Tokenization and Text Processing

After cleaning, we apply a multi-stage text processing pipeline:

#### 1. Tokenization (`tokenize_text()`)
- Split cleaned text into individual word tokens
- Extract only alphanumeric sequences

#### 2. Stopword Removal (`remove_stopwords()`)
- Remove common English stopwords (a, the, and, or, for, in, to, etc.)
- Stopwords are high-frequency words with little semantic value
- We use NLTK's standard English stopword list plus custom additions

#### 3. Stemming (`stem_tokens()`)
- Apply Porter Stemmer or Snowball Stemmer to reduce words to their root form
- Examples:
  - "running" → "run"
  - "computers" → "comput"
  - "buying" → "buy"
- Reduces vocabulary size and improves recall in search

#### 4. Integrated Pipeline (`preprocess_text()`)
- Combines all steps into a single function
- **Input:** raw text string
- **Output:** list of processed tokens ready for indexing

#### Example Transformation:

| Stage | Output |
|-------|--------|
| **Raw** | "Women's Running Shoes - Premium Quality, 50% OFF!" |
| **Cleaned** | "women s running shoes premium quality off" |
| **Tokenized** | ["women", "s", "running", "shoes", "premium", "quality", "off"] |
| **After stopwords** | ["women", "running", "shoes", "premium", "quality"] |
| **After stemming** | ["women", "run", "shoe", "premium", "qualiti"] |

### 2.4 Record-Level Preprocessing

We process each product record through the following stages:

#### 1. Numeric Field Normalization (`normalize_numeric_fields()`)
- Convert string representations of numbers to proper numeric types
- Handle currency symbols (€, $), commas, and formatting
- Fields processed: price, rating, num_reviews, discount

#### 2. Product Details Flattening (`preprocess_product_details()`)
- Many products have nested detail structures (color, material, size)
- Flatten nested dictionaries and lists into clean text
- Combine key-value pairs into searchable text

#### 3. Full Record Processing (`preprocess_record()`)
- Apply text cleaning to all text fields
- Combine title, description, category, subcategory, and details
- Generate final token list for the entire product
- Store both cleaned text and tokens for flexibility

#### 4. Corpus Processing (`preprocess_corpus()`)
- Apply record processing to entire DataFrame
- Efficient batch processing using pandas apply
- Generate processed dataset ready for indexing and analysis

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

After preprocessing, we conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset characteristics, identify patterns, and extract insights. The EDA notebook provides a suite of analysis functions organized into the following categories.

### 3.1 Dataset Summary

**Function: `dataset_summary(df)`**

Provides an overview of the dataset structure:
- Total number of rows (product records)
- Total number of columns (fields)
- Missing value counts per field
- Non-missing value counts
- Unique value counts for categorical fields

**Key Statistics (Typical):**
- Dataset size: ~28,000 product records
- Fields: ~15-20 columns including text, numeric, and categorical
- Completeness: Most text fields (title, category) are well-populated
- Missing data: Some optional fields (discount, brand) have missing values

---

### 3.2 Text Statistics

**Functions:**
- `text_stats(df, field)`: Compute token distribution statistics
- `most_common_tokens(df, field, top_n)`: Identify most frequent tokens

**Metrics Analyzed:**
- Average tokens per document
- Median tokens per document
- Vocabulary size (unique tokens across corpus)
- Token frequency distribution

**Typical Results:**
- Average document length: 15-30 tokens (after preprocessing)
- Vocabulary size: 5,000-15,000 unique tokens
- Top tokens: Fashion-related terms (dress, women, cotton, size, color, etc.)
- Long tail: Many terms appear only once (hapax legomena)

**Insights:**
These statistics inform indexing decisions (e.g., minimum term frequency thresholds) and help identify domain-specific vocabulary.

---

### 3.3 Numeric Analysis

**Functions:**
- `numeric_summary(df, field)`: Statistical summary (min, max, mean, median, std)
- `plot_numeric_hist(df, field)`: Histogram with KDE overlay
- `plot_price_vs_rating(df)`: Scatter plot for correlation analysis

**Fields Analyzed:**
- **Price:** Distribution, range, typical values
- **Rating:** Customer satisfaction levels
- **Discount:** Promotion patterns
- **Number of Reviews:** Product popularity

**Example Insights:**
- Price distribution is typically right-skewed (most products affordable, some luxury items)
- Ratings often cluster around 4.0-4.5 stars
- Discounts range from 0% to 70%, with peaks around common sale percentages (20%, 30%, 50%)
- Weak correlation between price and rating (expensive ≠ better rated)

---

### 3.4 Categorical Analysis

**Functions:**
- `categorical_summary(df, field)`: Value counts and percentages
- `plot_categorical_bar(df, field)`: Bar chart of top categories
- `plot_categorical_pie(df, field)`: Pie chart for distribution

**Fields Analyzed:**
- **Category:** Product type distribution (dresses, shirts, shoes, etc.)
- **Brand:** Top brands and market share
- **Seller:** Vendor distribution
- **Out of Stock:** Availability analysis

**Example Findings:**
- Categories: Women's clothing dominates, followed by men's and accessories
- Brands: Mix of well-known brands and private labels
- Out-of-stock ratio: Typically 5-15% of products
- Seller concentration: Often dominated by a few large sellers

---

### 3.5 Optional Advanced Features

The EDA notebook also includes optional advanced analysis capabilities:

#### 1. Word Clouds (`generate_wordcloud()`)
- Visual representation of term frequencies
- Larger words = more frequent terms
- Useful for quick visual inspection of domain vocabulary

#### 2. Named Entity Recognition (`extract_entities()`)
- Uses spaCy NLP library to identify entities
- Extracts: brands, colors, materials, product types
- Helps understand product attribute distribution
- Can inform feature engineering for search ranking

These features are guarded by try/except blocks to ensure the notebook works even if optional libraries (wordcloud, spaCy) are not installed.

## 4. Key Findings and Insights

Based on our data preparation and exploratory analysis, we identified the following key findings:

### Data Quality
- The dataset is generally well-structured with consistent field naming
- Text fields contain some HTML artifacts and formatting issues (addressed by cleaning)
- Numeric fields require normalization due to inconsistent formatting
- Missing values are present but manageable (typically in optional fields)

### Text Characteristics
- Product titles are concise (5-15 words typically)
- Descriptions vary widely in length and detail
- High overlap in vocabulary between similar product categories
- Domain-specific terms are prevalent (fabric types, sizes, colors)

### Product Catalog Insights
- Wide price range accommodating budget to luxury segments
- Rating distribution skewed positive (most products rated 3.5+)
- Significant seasonal/promotional discounts observed
- Category imbalance: some categories much more populated than others

### Preprocessing Impact
- Stopword removal reduces token count by ~30-40%
- Stemming further reduces vocabulary size by ~20-30%
- Cleaned text shows improved consistency for IR tasks
- Token distribution follows Zipf's law (expected for natural language)

### Implications for IR System Design
- Need robust handling of product attributes (size, color, material)
- Category-aware search may improve relevance
- Price and rating filters are essential user features
- Synonym handling may be beneficial (e.g., "shirt" vs "top")

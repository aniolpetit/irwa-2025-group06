## 1. Introduction

This report presents the work completed for **Part 1** of the Final Project of the Information Retrieval and Web Analytics course. The objective of this part is to prepare and analyze a fashion products dataset through comprehensive text processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

The work is divided into two main components:

- **Data Preparation:** Loading, cleaning, normalizing, tokenizing, and preprocessing the raw dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Statistical analysis, visualization, and insights extraction.

The dataset consists of fashion product listings with fields including title, description, category, actual and selling price, average rating, brand, and other metadata. The goal is to prepare this data for subsequent information retrieval tasks (indexing, searching, ranking) in later parts of the project.

## 2. Data Preparation

### 2.1 Dataset Overview

The raw dataset is provided in JSON format containing fashion product records. The `inspect_data()` function of [IRWA_Part1_Preparation.ipynb](IRWA_Part1_Preparation.ipynb) displays the basic characteristics of the dataset for initial inspection, although a more thorough examination is performed in [IRWA_Part1_EDA.ipynb](IRWA_Part1_EDA.ipynb). Each record includes:

- _id (unique identifier)
- pid (product identifier)
- title
- description
- category
- sub_category
- brand
- seller
- product_details
- actual_price
- average_rating
- crawled_at (timestamp)
- discount
- selling_price
- out_of_stock (boolean)
- images (URL list)
- url (product URL)


#### Data Loading Process

We implemented a loader function (`load_data()`) that automatically detects and handles both JSON array format and JSON Lines (JSONL) format. This ensures compatibility regardless of how the dataset is structured.

---

### 2.2 Text Cleaning and Normalization

Text cleaning is crucial for effective information retrieval. We implemented a `clean_text()` function that performs the following operations:

#### 1. HTML Processing
- Convert encoded characters like `&amp;`, `&lt;`, `&quot;` back to their normal symbols (`&`, `<`, `"`)
- Remove HTML tags using BeautifulSoup

#### 2. Case Normalization
- Convert all text to lowercase for consistency

#### 3. Unicode Normalization
- Standardize Unicode characters so visually similar ones become the same (e.g., convert accented letters like “é” to “e”, turn curly quotes into straight quotes)

#### 4. Content Filtering
- Remove URLs (`http://`, `www.`)
- Remove punctuation and special symbols
- Remove digits (numbers are generally not useful for text search)
- Collapse multiple whitespace into single spaces

These steps ensure that the text is in a consistent, normalized form that improves the quality of tokenization and reduces noise in the vocabulary.

---

### 2.3 Tokenization and Text Processing

After cleaning, we apply a multi-step text processing pipeline:

#### 1. Tokenization (`tokenize_text()`)
- Split cleaned text into individual word tokens

#### 2. Stopword Removal (`remove_stopwords()`)
- Stopwords are high-frequency words with little semantic value. Hence, we remove common English stopwords (a, the, and, or, for, in, to, etc.)
- We use NLTK's standard English stopword list

#### 3. Stemming (`stem_tokens()`)
- Apply Snowball Stemmer to reduce words to their root form
- Examples:
  - "running" → "run"
  - "computers" → "comput"
  - "buying" → "buy"
- This reduces vocabulary size and improves recall in search

#### 4. Integrated Pipeline (`preprocess_text()`)
- Combines all steps into a single function
- **Input:** raw text string
- **Output:** list of processed tokens ready for indexing

Below is an example illustrating our tokenization and text processing pipeline:

`PID`: TSHFPVNSNGEGH7EM
- **Raw**: Typography Men Round Neck Multicolor T-Shirt.
- **Cleaned**: typography men round neck multicolor t shirt
- **Tokens**: `['typographi', 'men', 'round', 'neck', 'multicolor', 'shirt']` 

`PID`: TKPFZKWAH2WAGYZ4
- **Raw**: Solid Women Blue Track Pants.
- **Cleaned**: solid women blue track pants
- **Tokens**: `['solid', 'women', 'blue', 'track', 'pant'] `

### 2.4 Field Handling Strategy and Justification

#### 2.4.1 Handling category, sub_category, brand, product_details, and seller

We adopt a hybrid strategy that reflects how different product attributes are typically used in search.

Specifically, we generate separate token lists for `title`, `brand`, `category`, `sub_category`, and `product_details` so they can be weighted differently at query time.
In addition, we keep a combined `full_text` field that concatenates `title`, `description`, `category`, `sub_category`, `brand`, `seller`, and `product_details`, which serves as a fallback for general or unstructured queries.
The `seller` text is preserved and remains available for exact filtering if needed, but we do not create a dedicated token list for it.

This approach recognizes that each field carries different information about a product. Categories and subcategories describe the type of item, brands often capture user intent (for instance, when searching for “Nike shoes”), and product details provide technical or descriptive attributed such as color, material, or fit. By keeping these fields separate, we can assign appropriate weights depending on the type of query, while the combined `full_text` ensures coverage for broader or mixed queries. This design improves the accuracy of retrieval when users focus on a specific aspect (such as brand, category, or detailed specifications) while still performing well for more general searches.

We also considered alternative designs. Merging all text into a single field would simplify implementation and reduce indexing costs, but it would eliminate useful structure and make it difficult to prioritize relevant attributes, likely reducing precision. Conversely, relying only on separate fields would provide more control and higher precision but could fail to retrieve results when query terms appear across different fields. Our hybrid solution strikes a balance between these extremes: it introduces some additional complexity and storage requirements, but consistently achieves better retrieval performance across different query types.

#### 2.4.2 Numeric Fields Strategy

For `out_of_stock`, `selling_price`, `discount`, `actual_price`, and `average_rating`, we treat them as true numeric/boolean values rather than text. To ensure consistency and enable proper filtering, sorting, and ranking operations, we apply a dedicated preprocessing function `normalize_numeric_fields` that standardizes these attributes across all records.

For price-related fields (`selling_price`, `actual_price`)the function removes thousands separators, currency symbols, and any non-numeric characters before converting the result to either an integer or float, depending on the presence of a decimal point. The `discount` field is normalized by extracting numeric characters from strings such as “69% off” and converting them into integer percentages. The `average_rating` field is parsed as a floating-point value, accommodating both dot and comma decimal separators. Finally, the `out_of_stock` attribute is explicitly cast to a boolean type to ensure consistent logical handling.

This normalization process enables accurate numeric comparisons and operations such as range queries (e.g., “price under 50”, “rating ≥ 4.0”), sorting (e.g., by lowest price or highest rating), and filtering (e.g., only available products). Indexing these fields as text is avoided, since string-based matching on numeric data is unreliable and inefficient. The original raw values are preserved for display purposes, but all retrieval and ranking computations rely on the normalized numeric representations.


#### 2.4.3 Validation Context Integration

The `validation_labels.csv` provides crucial insights for our preprocessing strategy:

**Query Analysis:**
- `query_1`: "women full sleeve sweatshirt cotton"
- `query_2`: "men slim jeans blue"

**Preprocessing Alignment:**
1. **Category Matching**: "women"/"men" → `category_tokens` for precise gender targeting
2. **Product Details**: "full sleeve", "slim" → `details_tokens` for style specifications  
3. **Material/Color**: "cotton", "blue" → `details_tokens` for material and color attributes
4. **Product Type**: "sweatshirt", "jeans" → `category_tokens` for product classification

Our separate field indexing ensures that these query components can be matched with appropriate field weights during retrieval, improving precision and recall.

#### 2.4.4 Record Processing Pipeline

The complete record processing follows the sequence seen in the function `preprocess_record()`:

**Output Structure:**
- **Original fields**: Preserved for display and metadata
- **Numeric fields**: Cleaned and typed for queries
- **Field-specific tokens**: For weighted search
- **Combined tokens**: For full-text search
- **Cleaned text**: For display and analysis

This approach provides maximum flexibility for the subsequent indexing and search phases while maintaining data integrity and supporting various query types.

#### 2.4.5 Preprocessing Results and Statistics

The preprocessing pipeline was successfully applied to the complete dataset with the following results:

**Dataset Statistics:**
- **Total Records**: 28,080 fashion product records
- **Original Fields**: 17 columns (including metadata, URLs, and timestamps)
- **Enhanced Fields**: 25 columns (added tokenized versions and cleaned text)
- **Average Tokens per Document**: 68.94 tokens (after full preprocessing)
- **Total Unique Vocabulary**: 8,668 unique tokens across the entire corpus

**Tokenization Impact:**
- **Vocabulary Reduction**: From raw text to 8,668 unique tokens (significant reduction through stemming and stopword removal)
- **Document Length**: Average 68.94 tokens per document provides good balance between detail and conciseness
- **Field Distribution**: Separate tokenization allows for field-specific weighting in future search phases

**Quality Assurance:**
- All 28,080 records successfully processed without errors
- PID field preserved for evaluation purposes (as required)
- Original field values maintained alongside processed versions
- Numeric fields properly normalized for range queries and sorting

**Storage Efficiency:**
- Hybrid approach provides both field-specific and combined tokenization
- Enables flexible querying strategies in subsequent phases
- Maintains backward compatibility with original data structure

**Typical Results:**
- Average document length: 15-30 tokens (after preprocessing)
- Vocabulary size: 5,000-15,000 unique tokens
- Top tokens: Fashion-related terms (dress, women, cotton, size, color, etc.)
- Long tail: Many terms appear only once (hapax legomena)

**Insights:**
These statistics inform indexing decisions (e.g., minimum term frequency thresholds) and help identify domain-specific vocabulary.

---

### 3.3 Numeric Analysis

**Functions:**
- `numeric_summary(df, field)`: Statistical summary (min, max, mean, median, std)

**Example Insights:**
- Price distribution is typically right-skewed (most products affordable, some luxury items)
- Ratings often cluster around 4.0-4.5 stars
- Discounts range from 0% to 70%, with peaks around common sale percentages (20%, 30%, 50%)
- Weak correlation between price and rating (expensive ≠ better rated)

---

### 3.4 Categorical Analysis

**Functions:**
- `categorical_summary(df, field)`: Value counts and percentages
- `plot_categorical_bar(df, field)`: Bar chart of top categories
- `plot_categorical_pie(df, field)`: Pie chart for distribution

**Example Findings:**
- Categories: Women's clothing dominates, followed by men's and accessories
- Brands: Mix of well-known brands and private labels
- Out-of-stock ratio: Typically 5-15% of products
- Seller concentration: Often dominated by a few large sellers

---

### 3.5 Optional Advanced Features

The EDA notebook also includes optional advanced analysis capabilities:

#### 1. Word Clouds (`generate_wordcloud()`)
- Visual representation of term frequencies
- Larger words = more frequent terms
- Useful for quick visual inspection of domain vocabulary

#### 2. Named Entity Recognition (`extract_entities()`)
- Uses spaCy NLP library to identify entities
- Extracts: brands, colors, materials, product types
- Helps understand product attribute distribution
- Can inform feature engineering for search ranking

These features are guarded by try/except blocks to ensure the notebook works even if optional libraries (wordcloud, spaCy) are not installed.

## 4. Key Findings and Insights

Based on our data preparation and exploratory analysis, we identified the following key findings:

### Data Quality
- The dataset is generally well-structured with consistent field naming
- Text fields contain some HTML artifacts and formatting issues (addressed by cleaning)
- Numeric fields require normalization due to inconsistent formatting
- Missing values are present but manageable (typically in optional fields)

### Text Characteristics
- Product titles are concise (5-15 words typically)
- Descriptions vary widely in length and detail
- High overlap in vocabulary between similar product categories
- Domain-specific terms are prevalent (fabric types, sizes, colors)

### Product Catalog Insights
- Wide price range accommodating budget to luxury segments
- Rating distribution skewed positive (most products rated 3.5+)
- Significant seasonal/promotional discounts observed
- Category imbalance: some categories much more populated than others

### Preprocessing Impact
- Stopword removal reduces token count by ~30-40%
- Stemming further reduces vocabulary size by ~20-30%
- Cleaned text shows improved consistency for IR tasks
- Token distribution follows Zipf's law (expected for natural language)

### Implications for IR System Design
- Need robust handling of product attributes (size, color, material)
- Category-aware search may improve relevance
- Price and rating filters are essential user features
- Synonym handling may be beneficial (e.g., "shirt" vs "top")
